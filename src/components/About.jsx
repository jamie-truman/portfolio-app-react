              I'm Jamie and I'm an aspiring web developer with a passion for
              technology and learning. I really enjoyed learning python
              throughout school and lost that knowledge when I decided to go to
              university for 2 years. I really didn't feel I was learning what I
              wanted to from university and decided to make a change to dev
              academy. Iâ€™ve learned so much and hope I can carry the skills I've
              learned over into my career. One of the skills I value the most
              from dev academy is being able to work in a team. Throughout the
              course we were paired up with people to work through tasks and I
              feel I have a much greater respect for working in teams and feel I
              am able to do it efficiently. I really look forward to meeting new
              people and continuing to learn in my new tech career.{' '}
